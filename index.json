This project has adapted Progressive Growing GAN for stable training and generations in a higher resolution.\nProgressive Growing GAN Progressive Growing GAN uses He initialization, pixelwise normalization, minibatch standard deviation, equalized learning rate for convolutions, exponential running average, and blending layers with different resolutions. This fading technique helps the network to get stablized. The MNIST dataset was used in early stage to make sure that the network works well as shown in Misc section.\nTraining The neural network was trained on the topology data and surface color from NASA's Visible Earth.\nThe training process combines the colors of the earth's surface and it's topology, which enables the network to generate both colors and heights of a terrain like below:\n    generated terrain colors      generated heights   These generated samples can be visualized in 3D.\n3.1 Terrain Visualization in 3D The below video shows how the generated terrains can be visualized in 3D.\n  The generations from fixed random latent vectors were tracked, and their training progress in 3D representations were captured as below:\n3.2 Training Visualization in 3D We can see how the GAN is combining various features in the visualization, which we cannot see in the visualization of 2D.\n  3.2 Training Visualization in 2D The left half is how surface colors are generated and the right half shows the corresponding heights.\n  Acknowledgement This research project was advised by Prof. Eric Shaffer.\nMisc.

DeepMind has especially utilized Q-learning, and evolved the idea to the next level by adapting non-linear model. Instead of Q table, Neural network is now used to predict the values, which is called Deep Q Network. The CNN and Deep Q-learning is what DeepMind’s work is all about.\nProblem DQN has to observe a game from ATARI and be trained to beat human level performance. Since Space Invader was the main example of early Deep-Mind’s paper, we are going to chose the game for this project. We are going to train our model to achieve the score of 500, which is the result of \u0026ldquo;Playing atari with deep reinforcement learn- ing.\u0026quot;, the first DeepMind’s paper. And Space Invader is a game that human level performance is hard to achieve in the early works of DQN.\nRelated Work DeepMind’s two early papers has two versions; we chose the version that uses three convolutional layers and one FC layer with 512 hidden units. This particular model for Space Invader has 6 outputs. All of the layers are followed by ReLU except the last output layer.\nTarget Network Because of the shifting weights of Q model, DeepMind has suggested to use two Q networks. This is related to divergence of Reinforcement Learning. The first network consistently updates as normal DNN would, but the second network, called the target network, doesn’t have sequential updates but is used to estimate the value of next state. Because of this it’s updated every 10,000 frames, but this can be changed through hyperparameter settings. According to the Deep-Mind’s paper, target network prevents of falling into a bad local minima and shifting weights. Thus, the target network has different set of parameters θ.\nExperience Replay Our problem includes correlations of sequences of input which consists of actions and states. In order to break this, DeepMind suggests to use Experience Replay. Experience Replay is another word for big sampling pool. The continuous sequences of data can be recorded to become a large pool, which can be used for sampling later. As we get more and more data, having correlation between sampled batch is more unlikely. Thereby, sampled batchs can be treated as if they are independent themselves.\nDQL Agent playing Space Invaders   Acknowledgement  This project was advised by Justin Sirignano.

Visualizing Mandelbrot set in realtime Mandelbrot set can be visualized using OpenGL and cuda together as above. If this is rendered using CPU1, its FPS is as below:\n   CPU usage   There is no parallelization with the base CPU model. Procedural double loop and heavy calculation is very slow that causes the rendering to become uninteractive. This is, however, very a good subject for the GPU parallel computation. Because, it has a small amount of branchings and rare memory access. Each pixel will have independency for computation in lots of cases.\n2. Using GPU for realtime visualization Converting double loop to a single loop is simple in case of rendering mandelbrot set, since PBO has a linear memory space. Similar to parallel histogram computation, the distrbution of computation can be easily done with GPU model.\nUsing proper amount of threads boosts the speed as following:\n   GPU usage   The left shows a kernel with 49x1024 threads, which boosts about 333 times compared to the base model. With proper thread-block dimension, 15% more improvement can be acheived.\n3. n-stream rendering The above kernel in section 2 renders about 42 pixels per thread 2, where each thread's memory access will be about 168 bytes apart with no global memory access. Even for writing, it is better to coalesce the memory access for a better cache use. Instead of reindexing the writing process, changing the calculation level to per-pixel base can help for speeding up the calculation with a parallelization. Using 42 streams with 376x128 threads can speed up even more as below:\n   GPU speedup with streams   This is about 650 times faster than the base CPU model. The use of shared memory could not speed up the process since the GPU model didn't depend on previously calculated values. The realtime visualization of Mandelbrot set was a problem for how to distribute the computation than how to optimize the kernel.\n4.
